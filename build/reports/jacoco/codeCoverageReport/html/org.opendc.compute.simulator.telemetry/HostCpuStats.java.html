 * Statistics about the CPUs of a host.

 * @param stealTime The cumulative CPU time (in seconds) that virtual machines were ready to run, but were not able to.
 * @param lostTime The cumulative CPU time (in seconds) that was lost due to interference between virtual machines.
 * @param capacity The available CPU capacity of the host (in MHz).
 * @param demand Amount of CPU resources (in MHz) the guests would use if there were no CPU contention or CPU
 *               limits.
 * @param usage Amount of CPU resources (in MHz) actually used by the host.
 * @param utilization The utilization of the CPU resources (in %) relative to the total CPU capacity.
